      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> My family, from both sides are from Latvia. Which is a country many don't know about- this really came in handy during my younger school days in Social Studies class whenever we'd have to 'pick a country to study'. Ask me about the 'songs' I cleverly created shortly before my presentations that always yielded a good grade! Another fun fact is that I'm the only person in the US with my last name, which will double next year when my fiance and I get married. I'm a laid back kind of person- who enjoys having a houseful of friends over just as much as being quarantined at home during this Pandemic. I live with my fiance and our two polar-opposite dogs; one of which has one eye and is alpaca-soft and the other is a couch potato herding pup. I keep LaCroix in business and prefer Costco over Sam's Club hands down.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Indianapolis, Indiana</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Ballroom Dancing, Movies, Spending time with my pups (Atlas & Appollo), Traveling, Foodie, Hiking, and Excerise </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be in position where I can enjoy traveling the world, working remotely while making an impact on people lives and feeling that my job isn't considered a "job." </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Denver, Colorado</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development combines creativity and analytical skills perfectly. It's for the detail-oriented and those with an eye for design as well as the ability to create anything that comes to mind with only the help of a computer. The skill to code anything by learning programming languages.</p>
